# We are all fireflies:
Life is full of precious moments of connectivity with our loved one that we forget. What if we could create a different type of language in archiving our moments? What if we could see our memories in the shape of patterns? In my research, I became interested in fireflies' synchronization as a romantic communication, their patterns, and that they are metaphors for precious time in Zen. My world is a world of people who need to feel their life more, and have the most of it with people whom they love (alive or dead).

# Scope:
 Fireflies come to help people to see their moments of connectivity and archive them. As much as they become older, they will have more fireflies, and when they die, they will become a firefly in the pattern of the other's memories. 

 What I wanna research on is:
 1. The gestures of drawing,archiving,ignoring,... of people
 2. The Japanese animes and art about fireflies
 3. Maybe giving a fake firefly to people and ask about their interactions with it.
 3. Simplifying my story
