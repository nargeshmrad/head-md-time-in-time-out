# No-time moment
Based on the interviews about people's emotional and sexual relationship with their loved one, I learned that people completely forget about time in the emotional synchronization. People only experience a mutual ascending feeling. They can only say when this synchronization ended. This ending is the climax of synchronization. 
In this world, the time can be stopped and everything can be dissapeared except the two characters of the world. These two characters can build something based on their synchrony.
