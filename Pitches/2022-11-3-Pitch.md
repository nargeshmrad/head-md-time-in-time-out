Based on the field research and interviews, I understood that you totally forget about the concept of time when you experience emotional synchronization with someone. This emotional synchronization is related to how people's heartbeats become synced with each other. 
 So, I came to the idea of a world with two characters who can stop time, make others except them disappear, and experience a new form of communication. 
 This new interaction can happen between two people who don't even know each other. They will consider each other and start communication when they have an accidental heartbeat synchronization. This is the beginning of the story.
