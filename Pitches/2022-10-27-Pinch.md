I tried to observe the synchronization in humans, animals, and objects. Synchronization happens between things and individuals because of the physical or emotional closeness, having the tendency to line up, and being attracted to each other. It can also create deeper emotional interactions and help in sending messages.  Accordingly, my story is about the emotional synchronization between people, and how people can improvise synchronized emotions and develop telepathy for communication.
