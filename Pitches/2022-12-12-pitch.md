# Synching by Thinking
Synching with someone you have lost still happens but in terms of thinking about them and reminding their memories. In my project, you wear a piece of jewelry and whenever you think of your loved one, you can touch it to conjure them. They only can come in the shape of lights. Based on the grief stage you are in, you can translate this pattern to a poem which your loved one is telling you to help you pass this stage and continue life.
