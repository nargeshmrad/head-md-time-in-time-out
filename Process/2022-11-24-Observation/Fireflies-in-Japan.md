# Fireflies in Japan religion
Merrily Baird in her Symbols of Japan: Thematic Motifs in Art and Design (pp. 110-111) notes that "As early as the Nara period..." fireflies were a poetic symbol for passionate love. During the Heian period the nobility went on outings to view and capture these insects on warm summer nights. "From the Chinese, the Japanese appear to have derived the custom of viewing fireflies as souls of the dead..." The ones at the Uji River near Kyōto even came to represent the deceased warriors of the opposing armies of the struggle between the Minamoto and Taira clans during the 12th century.  "Given it's size..." Baird concludes "...the firefly does not lend itself to solo treatment on a large scale."

The modern Chinese word for fluorescence is made up of the characters for firefly (螢) and light (光).


"In the Tale of Genji... Prince Hotaru, Genji's half-brother, catches his first glimpse of Lady Tamakazura by the light of fireflies."
